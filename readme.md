# KSP Orbital Kalculator

## What is it?

KSP Orbital Kalculator is a utility designed to assist players of the videogame Kerbal Space Program in travelling between planets. The application allows the user to input the planet they wish to start from, the planet they wish to travel to, and the height of the orbit they will be starting from. The application then calculates the required angles, change in velocity, and escape velocity for the transfer maneuver between the two planets. Finally, the application displays the calculated information numerically on the main interface, and graphically on the two angle display interfaces.
