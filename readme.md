# KSP Orbital Kalculator

## What is it?

KSP Orbital Kalculator is a utility designed to assist players of the videogame Kerbal Space Program in travelling between planets. The application allows the user to input the planet they wish to start from, the planet they wish to travel to, and the height of the orbit they will be starting from. The application then calculates the required angles, change in velocity, and escape velocity for the transfer maneuver between the two planets. Finally, the application displays the calculated information numerically on the main interface, and graphically on the two angle display interfaces.

## Background

### What is Kerbal Space Program?

Kerbal Space Program is a management and space flight simulation gaming developed by Squad. In the game, the player is in charge of running a space program of little green men called Kerbals, from the planet Kerbin. Players design and pilot spacecraft, which can be piloted to perform missions. Missions will often involve travelling to other locations, either on the planet Kerbin, in orbit, or on other bodies (e.g. planets or moons) in the Kerbol system.

### What is a Hohmann transfer maneuver?

A Hohmann transfer orbit is a half elliptical orbit used to transfer a spacecraft from one circular orbit of a central body into a different circular orbit of the same body. A Hohmann transfer maneuver is an orbital maneuver which consists of two impulses. First, an impulse is used to change the spacecraft's circular orbit into an elliptical orbit which intersects with the desired orbit. Once the spacecraft travels along its Hohmann orbit to reach the intersection with the desired orbit, a second impulse is used to circularize the orbit.

A Hohmann transfer can be used to move from a lower orbit into a higher orbit, or vice-versa. A variation of the Hohmann transfer maneuver can be used to transfer between orbits of two bodies on different orbits around the same central body. The KSP Orbital Kalculator is designed to assist with this maneuver.
